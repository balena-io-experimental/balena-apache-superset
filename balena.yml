  ## Usage instructions
  
  Once your device joins the fleet you'll need to allow some time for it to download the application.
  
  Once the application is downloaded and running, you should be able to access it using the IP address of your device.
  The default username is `admin` and the default password is also `admin`. You may change the details of the default
  admin user after logging in by going to `Settings > Security > List Users` then editing the admin user details.
